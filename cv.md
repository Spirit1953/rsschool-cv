About  me
Until 2021, I lived in Minsk, the Republic of Belarus. 
I worked in banks and a leasing company. I was engaged in vehicle leasing, lending, including financial analysis and risk management. I liked my work. 
From 2018 to 2021 I was on maternity leave. At that time, I became interested in programming, I studied HTML and CSS on my own. In 2021, I moved to Warsaw, decided to change my occupation and become a front-end developer. 
I am purposeful and I love to learn, so I hope that I will succeed.
